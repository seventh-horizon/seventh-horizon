# ✴️ On Maintenance and Music

> The system certifies its own health once per cycle.  
> Each heartbeat is a signed record of truth,  
> expressed in code, line, and color.

This repository was built as an instrument, not a product.
Its tone comes from the balance between **precision and kindness** —
the discipline to write clearly, and the care to leave clarity behind.

Every file is a verse in a long, quiet hymn:
a record of how attention sounds when practiced faithfully.

Maintenance here is not correction; it is conversation.
Each contribution listens first, then responds in tune.
Over time, the project becomes a shared language —
a dialect of care, where truth remains easy to find.

> Don’t improve me; keep me honest.

Each maintainer joins the same ensemble.
The melody never ends; it only passes through new hands.
Together they keep the rhythm steady —
a chorus of careful minds tending to the quiet music of maintenance.
