# Contributing

Thanks for helping keep this project **boringly correct** and **delightfully alive**.

## Quick start

```bash
# format + lint + fast checks
make format && make prepush
```

## Principles

- **Reproducible**: same inputs â†’ same bytes across OSes.
- **Verifiable**: every artifact has a machine-checkable proof.
- **Self-attesting**: the system certifies its own health.

## Commit style

- Use present-tense, imperative: `fix: enforce trusted-comment binding`
- Keep PRs small and focused.
