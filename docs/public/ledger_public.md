# Seventh Horizon — System Ledger (v1.0)

> **Purpose:** Single source of truth for all cycle states, summaries, and telemetry context.  
> **Rule:** Append-only. Archive snapshots in `/archives`.

## [epoch_0004] Cycle 4 — Interlock & Stabilization
**Date:** [redacted-phone]  
**Mode:** Deep Build  
**Signal:** 0.92  
**Resonance:** 0.87  
**Entropy:** 0.18  

**Summary:**  
Cycle 4 completed in ~26 hours. Full system interlock across UI, telemetry, and sorting. CI/Playwright clean. Transition to Observatory phase confirmed.

**Next:**  
- Cycle 5 — Observatory Panels & Narrative Linkage  
- Build panels + telemetry summary generator  
- Prep convergence bridge to Cycle 6 cognition loop

**Continuation Note ([redacted-phone]):** Cycle 4 remains operationally active for stabilization (HCC polish, test flake hunts, doc hygiene). The ledger is closed structurally to enable Cycle 5 prep, but Cycle 5 is not publicly “started” until these C4 tasks are green:
- Fuse.js in HCC Command Palette
- SessionCard/AddSession → state updates (no reload)
- Lightweight UI smoke tests (Dashboard, SessionCard)
- Snapshot/public docs pass hygiene

Status gates for public C5 start: ✅ CI green, ✅ reproducible demo, ✅ doc hygiene, 🟡 HCC polish in flight.
