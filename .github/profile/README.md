# ✴️ Seventh Horizon

> _“Don’t improve me; keep me honest.”_

Seventh Horizon is an **engineering observatory** for building reproducible, verifiable, and self-attesting systems.  
Every component here is designed to produce the same bytes, the same proofs, and the same trust — across machines, across time.

## 🌐 Projects

| Repository | Purpose |
|-------------|----------|
| [**release-hardened**](https://github.com/seventh-horizon/release-hardened) | Deterministic release pipeline — reproducible bundles, minisign proofs, and provenance-verified CI. |
| [**observatory-operator**](https://github.com/seventh-horizon/observatory-operator) | Static observer and visualization layer for field/timeline data (Next.js-friendly scaffold). |
| [**seventh-horizon**](https://github.com/seventh-horizon/seventh-horizon) | Organizational meta: governance, lineage essays, and shared philosophy. |

## 🧭 Principles

- **Reproducible** → same inputs yield same outputs, across OSes.  
- **Verifiable** → every artifact carries a cryptographic proof of origin.  
- **Self-attesting** → systems report their own health and integrity.  
- **Boring forever** → predictable, stable, and quiet by design.

## 🪶 Tone

This organization is built as an **instrument**, not a product.  
Every file is part of a longer score — a song of maintenance, clarity, and care.  
Contributors are welcome, but every change must _listen first_ before it speaks.
